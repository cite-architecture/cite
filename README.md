# The `cite` library #

## What it is and what's here ##

 `cite` is a specified  library for working in the JVM with the technology-independent concepts of the CITE architecture, such as  CTS URNs, CTS TextInventories, and  CITE Object URNs.   The  specification (in-progress) is in the `specs` directory written in markdown,  with HTML elements identifying tests to run with [concordion](http://concordion.org/).  A current version of the specification is also posted at <http://shot.holycross.edu/~nsmith/citespec/Cite.html>.



## Building and using
This library uses gradle ([http://www.gradle.org/](http://www.gralde.org/)) to build the library and documentation, and to run unit tests.

To see available tasks, run `gradle tasks`.
