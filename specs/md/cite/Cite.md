# A CITE library for the JVM #

This documentation specifies a code library implementing technology-independent concepts of the CITE architecture.  It is a "living document": it uses [concordion](http://concordion.org/) to test the implementation against the specification.  

When the specification and implementation are complete and synchronized, we will release version 1.0 of the library.
